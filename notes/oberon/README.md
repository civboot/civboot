# Project Oberon

See the main site page: http://projectoberon.com/

The entire source code is ~10,000 lines for a full operating system.
Unfortunately, it does not "self bootstrap" -- Oberon in it's entirety (both the
language the kernel) is written in Oberon. In order to compile Oberon with a
language like C you would have to write the entire language, not just a VM/etc.

However, that asside it appears to be an excellent reference for simple language
and kernel design. This directory will be used to store notes from my reading of
the langauge, along with learnings for Civboot software.
