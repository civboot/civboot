# Philosphy of Civboot

Civboot is not a criticism of the current complexity of technology. Technology
is (largely) as complex as we want it to be for the requirements we have:
hiding internal complexity, simplified and beautiful user interfaces, and
scalability of more engineers working on large-scale problems.

Civboot is founded on a philosophical idea: modern civilization would be better
off if it owned the means to produce it's essential components. This is not
to say that proprietary pieces of the tech stack are somehow _wrong_ (although
some believe that). Civboot is not an economic philosophy, it is a scientific
one. Humanity is better off when it can understand the technology it depends on,
and we can only understand what we can create.

You are probably thinking the _real_ goal of Civboot is to be able to survive
an apocalypse-type scenario. This was indeed one of the inspirations for Civboot,
and the project [CollapseOS](https://collapseos.org/) was a motivation for the current
technology stack that Civboot is pursuing. I believe that thinking along
"negative" outcomes such as "what happens if civilization collapses" is highly
productive to creativity, growth and learning in much the same way as death and
rot are essential for the growth of plants and sustenence of all life. Having a
noble goal of being educational and a motivational goal of concern for the
future provides a good balance from which I hope Civboot and its community can
thrive.

Civboot is and must remain completely free and open. In order to fulfill its
mission, it must be possible to have a working-understanding of every level of
its design -- from materials science, to manufacturing process, to mechanics,
to the computer hardware and software it is running. Included information and
processes should be as simple as possible -- these concepts should be easy to
learn and replicate. This constraint will force simplification of the designs,
ideas and software being included. We must take our complicated technology
stack and work on distilling it to its essentials, then rebuild upon those
essentials to be even more efficient and simple.

## Purpose

In terms of supporting a community with things like food, clothing and shelter,
a Civboot has one additional goal: be able to provide these things within three
degrees. For instance, a Civboot cannot construct a tractor directly, but you
can use tooling within a Civboot to build a factory (the 1st degree), then you
can use the factory to build gears and other tractor components and assemble a
tractor (the 2nd degree).
