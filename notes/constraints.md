# Constraints

The intent of these constraints is to limit the amount of tools and information
included in a Civboot into a manageable amount. These constraints (whether
included or excluded) make no judgement about the importance of said items
except as to apply to the goal of creating the first Civboot.

A Civboot...

- **Must** be entirely free and open.
  - **Must not** contain proprietary or hidden designs, i.e. no "binary blobs",
    no undocumented schematics, etc.
- **Must** be possible to build itself from itself
  - Requires no outside knowledge besides the language which the guides are
    written in
  - Requires no outside tooling besides commonly found materials (rocks, clay,
    wood, dirt, sand, ore, etc)
- **Must** include all working knowledge necessary to understand every
  component and their interactions.
  - **Must** include the theory and practice of math, physics, chemistry,
    materials science, computer design and programming, etc necessary to
    explain the design of every component in the system such that it can be
    replicated and have improvements made upon it.
  - **Must not** include information not necessary to understand or begin
    improvements upon the system. Aka must not include politics, history,
    medicine, philosophy, religion, art, psychology, sociology or any branch of
    human knowledge or endeavor outside of the sciences and engineering
    necessary to understand and improve the system. These are important to
    preserve, but it is not the goal of Civboot to preserve them.
    - Civboot **should** aid in providing the technology to store and view such
      knowledge where possible.
  - **May** include some amount of history of
    math/science/engineering/philosophy which is required to properly
    understand an idea/component and its tradeoffs.
- **Should** be as simple as possible but no simpler.
  - Comfort has almost no importance, unless it excessively hinders use.
  - Easy as possible to re-learn and re-create from near-scratch
- **Should** be as efficient as possible
  - Require as few materials / space / energy necessary to achieve its purpose.
    Improvements to these areas without increasing complexity should be
    accepted.
- **Should** focus on the "single city" design
  - Local communication protocols acceptable
  - Globalized transportation / communication not required (but allowed)
- **Should** be composed of modifiable and swappable designs
  - Stack will continue to improve in both simplicity and effectiveness -- no
    stage in stack should block this improvement
  - Stack should be upgradeable as components become simpler and more efficient
  - May include multiple (swappable) alternatives to perform same role with
    different tradeoffs
- **Should not** include knowledge or tools just for the sake of those who
  build it
  - For example, although the people working on a new Civboot need to eat,
    farming equipment and practices should not be included.
  - Some equipment, like a bulldozer/truck, have multiple purposes but may be
    required to build the Civboot itself so should be included.
  - Civboot **should** enable the storage/retrieval of such knowledge and
    construction of such tools

## Goals
The first goal of Civboot is to be able to create a technology stack which can
self-replicate with 500 motivated students in 8 years, starting with a
US-equivalent 8th grade education. In addition, the goal is to be able to
rebuild a Civboot (with a Civboot) for less than 25 million dollars --
or $50,000 per student, less than the typical cost of 8 years of education in
the United States.

In addition, there are (aspirationally) 5 Civboot levels. These are not part
of the core spec, but may help get creative juices flowing. They are documented
[here](../thoughts/levels.md)
