# Software

* Oberon systems, full notes at [`oberon/`](./oberon/README.md)
* [Rust layouts and ABIs](https://gankra.github.io/blah/rust-layouts-and-abis/):
  has some interesting details on what is required for rust to work at all
* [Adventures in Motion Control][AIMC]: guide on creating a CNC simulator to
  understand how they work better
* We'll want some kind of version control. Came across [ugit tutorial][ugit].
* Some kind of database and query language. The [D database language] seems like an
  excellent resource.
