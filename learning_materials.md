Just a collection of reading materials for learning Civboot related concepts.
Some of these are texts I am currently using.

Software:
- [Programming from the ground up][1]: Excellent introductory guide to how
  computers work. Starts teaching programming by teaching assembly. Highly
  recommended for beginners.
- [The Lost Art of Structure Packing][2]: good guide to how C-structs are
  defined, which is good for low-level thinking in software.
- [The little book about OS development][5]: not yet explored, but seems very
  relevant to learning the fundamentals. Note: it has a pdf at the link.

Non-essential but may be useful:
- Many concepts of fngi are from FORTH. [Starting Forth][4] is a good guide for
  the curious.
- For folks who have never learned a programming language before I recommend
  [Learn Python the Hard Way][3], at least while fngi and its documentation is
  still under development.
  - Reason: python is an excellent language for prototyping your ideas as well
    as writing test suites.
